Since my last post I have started collecting resources to learn R and Python, including using the Intermediate Python exercise on GitHub creating a basic dice roller. Hopefully I will be able to create a list of sites I found useful when learning these languages. 
Additionally, I have been reading papers about a disease group in which I am interested, namely IBD, and have been looking into the current medications employed.

Currently, my next step is going to be to do the Markdown tutorial on GitHub to make this blog look a little less bleak. 
I should probably include some form of art in this blog. 
Since I have also started classes for my masters and am also working part time, I'll see how often I really post to this blog, but ideally it should be updated frequently enough to give a good idea of my progress.
